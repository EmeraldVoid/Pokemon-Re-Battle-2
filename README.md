# What is Re: Battle?

Re: Battle 2 (formerly known as TestFlight) is a series of Pokemon battle sim games developed by Pixelated Bread Game Studios & Emerald_Void. If you wish to play the first itteration of the game, you can find it [here](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-TestFlight/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> The first iiteration of Re:Battle serves as a the primary building blocks and foundation of Re:Battle 2 so the gameplay may seem very familiar if you played Re:Battle 1. However, hopefully wiht newly added features, new interesting abttle mechanics and overall general improvement in knowledge of PSDK and RPGMaker XP, the experience of Re:Battle 2 will be mor eenjoyable.
