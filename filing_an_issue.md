## Important Notes

* This game is a **solo development project.** While I do my best to fix bugs, address balance concerns, and respond to feedback, **not every issue may be resolved immediately** or at all, depending on:

  * Whether it is within my current skills.
  * Whether it is feasible within the game's limitations.
  * Whether it fits the scope and vision of the project.

* **I will always try my best** to address any issues that are within my knowledge, skill set, and available time.

* Duplicate issues may be closed if the same problem has already been reported.

## Before Submitting

* Check if the issue has already been reported on the [Issues Page](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/Pokemon-Re-Battle-2/issues).
* Make sure you are using the **latest version of the game.**
* Provide as much detail as possible to help with troubleshooting or evaluation.
