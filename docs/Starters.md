After completing the Intro Cutscene, the player chooses from one of three starter Pokémon:

- Each Pokémon starts at level 95, allowing players to use the fully evolved forms immediately if they choose to evolve them early.
- Move Tutors are available to help players fully customize each Pokémon’s moveset to suit their battle strategy.
- Certain trainers will use **different teams** depending on **which starter you selected**.
