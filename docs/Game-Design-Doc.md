## 🏗️ **Core Features**

### 🔥 **Nuzlocke Mode (Hardcore Mode)**

* **Permanent Faint Rule:**
  Any Pokémon that faints is automatically and permanently removed from the player’s party and stored in a separate “Graveyard” box or deleted.

* **First Encounter Rule:**
  Only the *first wild Pokémon* encountered in each route, zone, or area may be caught. Failure to capture it means no Pokémon can be caught in that area.

* **Full Party Wipe Consequence:**
  If the player suffers a full party wipe, the run ends immediately. The player is sent back to the main menu to start a new run. There is no retry or checkpoint system.
